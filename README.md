In their landmark 1952 paper, Hodgkin and Huxley (HH) developed an elegant mathematical
model to describe the properties of the channels that generate and propagate the action
potential. To explain how changes in membrane potential led to a change in ionic conductance,
they deduced that a conformational change in the membrane component responsible must move
charged particles through the membrane electric field, generating a capacitive current. This was
conceptualized as independent gates for each channel that followed first order kinetics when
transitioning from open to closed states, with more rapid kinetics for Na+ gates compared to K+.
Individual gates open and close stochastically, but the probability of a gate being open is
dependent on the voltage across the membrane. Voltage clamp experiments revealed that the
change in conductance plotted over time followed a sigmoidal curve (suggesting a cooperative
process) during depolarization and an exponential curve (as expected for a single gate following
first order kinetics) during repolarization. The exact shape of the curve suggested 3 activation (m)
gates and a single inactivation (h) gate as the best estimate of the number of independent sodium
channel gates.
Notably, HH measured whole-cell currents. Subsequent patch-clamp experiments helped to
characterize single-channel current. Modern investigations into the molecular structure of the
voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav) have confirmed the validity of many aspects of this powerful
model. 
The Connor-Stevens model is similar to the Hodgkin-Huxley model but incorporates an additional transient K+ current. 
The basic pseudocode and channel equations are included in the respective files. Here i have coded the 2 models in MATLAB.
